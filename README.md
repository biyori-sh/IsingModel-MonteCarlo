# IsingModel-MonteCarlo

Introduction to the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of the Ising model in Japanese.

## Ising2d_MC

Notes of the Ising model and the MC simulation (the Metropolis method and the heat bath method) in Japanese.

MC simulation codes of the isotropic Ising mocdel using Python (calculting the magnetization, specific heat, Binder cumulant and correlation function).


## Ising2d_anisotropic

MC simulation codes of the asnisotropic Ising model using Python (calculating the magnetization).
